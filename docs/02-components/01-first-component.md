# Creating simple components - Without internal state
Writing a simple react component using reagent is just writing a normal CLJS
functions that takes some inputs and returns a hiccup

A simple reagent component looks something like 
```clojure
(defn simple-component [greeting name]
  [:div {:style {:color "blue"}}
   [:span greeting] [:span name] "!"])
```
We call this component as `[simple-component "Good Morning " "Robin Nagpal"]`.
It is important to note that we call the component using `[]` and don't call it
as a normal function like `(simple-component "Good Morning " "Robin Nagpal")`
 
```clojure
(reagent/render
    [simple-component "Good Morning " "Robin Nagpal"]
    (.getElementById js/document "app"))
```

# Internals  `CLJS function <==> React Component`
You will be overwhelmed with this section if you are just getting started with 
reagent. This might be of interest to you after you have created a few components
and now want to understand what exactly is happening behind the scenes. 

If we try to debug the rendered component in [react developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
we can relate how reagent converts function to a react component.

This is done in following steps

### 1. Determine element type 

### 2. Looks for component in cache
Reagent checks if the component is already present with this name(fully qualified) 
in the cache. Reagent doesn't keep a separate cache, but it looks for the property
`:cljsReactClass` on that function, if not present it creates a new component
of the function and sets `:cljsReactClass` property as newly created component 
class. Next time the same cljs function/component is accessed, the react component
set on `:cljsReactClass` will be reused. 



### 3. Creates new
            
### 4.  

# Updating the component



## By passing new props

## By updating ratom
